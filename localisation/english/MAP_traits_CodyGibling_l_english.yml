[pop.GetHerHis] empathy and political wisdom has allowed [pop.GetHerHim] to remain in power through genuine compassion where cruel despots would have been rooted out long ago, though [pop.GetSheHe] still has blood on [pop.GetHerHis] hands as all heroes and leaders unfortunately do, and [pop.GetHerHis] claims to have obtained some of [pop.GetHerHis] knowledge from \"another world\" seem dubious at best. Though somewhat worn down by the rigors and burdens [pop.GetSheHe] has taken on, [pop.GetSheHe] is still an optimist at heart and still hopes the countless dead sentients who have ever died in a cold, uncaring universe will not remain so... even if reality itself must be recalibrated to allow eternal life.\n----------\n$ursip_codygibling_txtfrag8$"
